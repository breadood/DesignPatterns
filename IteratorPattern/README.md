# Iterator Pattern

## Motivation:

To implement iterator API for other data constructs

## Use Case:

Iterating through trees structures, when iteration of a structure is needed.

## Example:

We should be able to iterate a `Tree` of `Node`s. We will need to implement `iterator()`, `begin()`, `end()`, and `operator++()` for `Node` in order to iterate through the `Tree`

## Advantage:

It is similar to a proxy design pattern.
