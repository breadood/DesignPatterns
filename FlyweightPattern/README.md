# Flyweight Pattern

## Motivation:

To avoid the redundancy use of memory/space. A space optimization method.

## Use Case:

A text formatter can capitalize a part of string. 

## Example:

Instead of having a boolean indicator for each character, we can instead save array of ranges to deal save the capitalization rules.

## Advantage:

Memory optimization.
