# State Pattern

## Motivation:

System behaves differently in different states.

## Use Case:

Implementing any state machine.

## Example:

In a particular state, the system can only do certain things. Need to use a lot of `enum class`

## Advantage:

Implementation of state machine, what each state does, and the transition.
